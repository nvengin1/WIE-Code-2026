# Day 2 – Decision-Making, Loops, Functions, and Wiring Basics

> **Welcome back!**  
> Yesterday we explored how to talk to your Arduino’s pins and make them act.  


## Mini Review of Day One

### Arduino default loops -- void setup () and void loop()
**void setup()**

Executes only once when the Arduino board powers on or resets.
Initialization tasks that must occur at the beginning of the program.
* Setting pin modes (e.g., pinMode(pin, OUTPUT) or pinMode(pin, INPUT)).
* Initializing serial communication (e.g., Serial.begin(9600)).
* Setting up libraries or sensors.

**void loop()**

Executes repeatedly after void setup() has finished.
Contains the main logic of the program, where the ongoing actions and operations are performed.
The code within void loop() runs continuously, allowing for tasks like:
* Reading sensor data.
* Controlling actuators (e.g., turning LEDs on/off, controlling motors).
* Implementing control algorithms.

### Arduino Pins

<img width="600" height="490" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/44c98db7-a4d5-4994-80ff-3a94c5964e9f" />

Three main I/O pin types on Arduino Uno: 
* 6 Analog Input pins (A0–A5) – read varying voltage values for sensors
* 14 Digital I/O pins – can read or send ON/OFF signals (HIGH/LOW)
* Of the 14 Digital I/O pins, 6 pins (3, 5, 6, 9, 10, and 11) support PWM


****
> Today, we’re going beyond simply turning things on and off — we’ll learn how to make your Arduino **think, decide, repeat tasks, and stay organized**.

---

## Why This Matters
When you write code for an Arduino, you’re not just telling it “do this.”  
You’re building **logic**:  
- **Decision-making** – Should the LED be on or off based on the sensor?  
- **Repetition** – How can I blink something 100 times without typing 100 commands?  
- **Organization** – How do I keep my code clean so I can actually read it later?  

---

## Today’s Roadmap
1. **If / Else If / Else** – Teach your Arduino to make choices.  
2. **For, While, Do-While** – Efficiently repeat actions without writing the same line over and over.  
3. **Functions** – Group related code into reusable “mini-programs” for cleaner, smarter sketches.  
4. **Coding Etiquette** – Learn how to comment, indent, and name things so your code makes sense to others (and future you).  
5. **More TinkerCAD** – Put these concepts into practice with simulations.  
6. **Wiring** – Physical connections that match your virtual designs.

---

## The Big Picture
By the end of today, you’ll be able to:
- Write code that **reacts** to input and changes behavior on the fly.
- Use loops to save time and prevent repetitive typing.
- Build and call your own functions for organization and reuse.
- Apply professional habits in your Arduino code.
- Confidently translate your TinkerCAD simulations to real-world wiring.

---

> **Tip for Today:**  
> If Day 1 was learning the alphabet, Day 2 is forming sentences.  
> You’re now writing *logic* that makes your Arduino smarter, more responsive, and easier to manage.

# 1. Conditionals, Loops, Functions, Arrays & Strings

> **Big idea:**  
> Day 1 taught you *how* to talk to pins.  
> **Day 2** is about *thinking*: making your Arduino **decide**, **repeat**, **organize**, and **remember** information.

---

## 1.1 Conditionals — Teaching Arduino to Make Decisions

**What are they?**  
Conditionals are "decision points" in your code — moments where the program must choose between two or more paths based on what’s happening.

We implement Boolean operations to evaluate and make decisions.
 
Imagine you’re at a crosswalk:  
- **If** the light is green → you walk.  
- **Else** (the light is red) → you wait.  

Your Arduino can do the same:  
- If a sensor reading is high, turn a motor on.  
- Else, keep it off.

  
Think about an automatic door:  
- If someone is detected by the motion sensor, it opens.  
- Else, it stays closed.

**Why important?**  
Without decisions, Arduino would just run the same fixed script forever — no interactivity.

```cpp
//if, elseif, else structure
if (condition1) {
  // do Thing A
}
else if (condition2) {
  // do Thing B
}
else {
  // do Thing C
}


//Example
if (temperature >= 70) {
 // Danger! Shut down the system.
}
else if (temperature >= 60) { // 60 <= temperature < 70
  // Warning! User attention required.
}
else { // temperature < 60
  // Safe! Continue usual tasks.
}
```

**Examples of conditions:**

These will always evaluate to 0 or 1, depending on whether the condition is true or false. This means conditions are always boolean expressions.

* x == y (x is equal to y)
* x != y (x is not equal to y)
* x < y (x is less than y)
* x > y (x is greater than y
* x <= y (x is less than or equal to y)
* x >= y (x is greater than or equal to y)

## 1.2 Loops — Repeating Without Copy–Paste

**What are they?**  
Loops let your Arduino run the same block of instructions multiple times without writing the same code over and over.

Telling a kid to “jump rope 10 times” vs. telling them “jump rope” 10 separate times in a row. One is efficient; one wastes breath.

A washing machine runs cycles — wash, rinse, spin — and repeats certain actions automatically. That’s a loop in real life.

**Why important?**  
Loops save time and make code flexible: change one number, and your Arduino could blink 3 times instead of 30.

### **Mini Breakout Activity 1 – Simple Button Control**
**Goal:** Press the pushbutton to turn ON an LED, release to turn it OFF.  
- Use `digitalRead()` to detect button press.
- Use `digitalWrite()` to control the LED.
- **Tip:** Try using both `INPUT` and `INPUT_PULLUP` modes to see the difference in logic.

### **Mini Breakout Activity 2 – If-Else LED Color Control**
**Goal:** Two LEDs:  
- If the button is pressed, the **red** LED turns ON and the **green** LED turns OFF.  
- If not pressed, the **green** LED turns ON and the **red** LED turns OFF.  
- This reinforces `if` vs. `else` control.

--- 

## 1.3 Functions — Reusable Mini-Programs

**What are they?**  
A function is a named block of code you can "call" whenever you need it.

A recipe card. Instead of rewriting the steps to make a sandwich every time you’re hungry, you follow the recipe you already have.

Think about a TV remote’s volume button — it’s the same internal steps every time, but you just press the button instead of building a new remote.

**Why important?**  
Functions keep code organized, reusable, and easier to fix.

<img width="704" height="312" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f5fedae4-8857-4e92-8b95-cf6f63065bc2" />

```cpp
//Super simple function example

int addOne(int num)
{
int newNum = num + 1; //adds 1 to parameter num and assigns to returned variable
return newNum;
}

int number = addOne(4)

Serial.print("\n\n");
Serial.print(number);

```

Built-in Arduino Functions:

---

## 1.4 Arrays — Keeping Many Things in One Box

**What are they?**  
Arrays let you store multiple values of the same type under one name.

A row of mailboxes — each has a number (index) so you can quickly find the one you need.

Instead of having a variable for `led1`, `led2`, `led3`, you have one container called `ledPins` that holds all three numbers.

**Why important?**  
They make it possible to do the same thing to many items without repeating code.

<img width="500" height="350" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b27d06f3-4565-447a-bf5c-e7c41bcf815c" />

```cpp
//Array Examples
// Declare an array of a given length without initializing the values:
int myInts[6];

// Declare an array without explicitly choosing a size (the compiler
// counts the elements and creates an array of the appropriate size):
int myPins[] = {2, 4, 8, 3, 6, 4};

// Declare an array of a given length and initialize its values:
int mySensVals[5] = {2, 4, -8, 3, 2};

// When declaring an array of type char, you'll need to make it longer
// by one element to hold the required the null termination character:
char message[6] = "hello";

```

---

## 1.5 Strings — Handling Text

**What are they?**  
Strings store text like `"Hello"` or `"Arduino"`.  

A string is like a beaded bracelet — each letter is a bead, strung together in order.

Your phone stores your name as a string in its contact list.

**Why important?**  
They let Arduino handle words, sentences, and messages for displays, serial communication, or Morse code.


```cpp
//Various valid string declarations

String stringOne = "Hello String";                    // using a constant String
String stringOne = String('a');                       // converting a constant char into a String
String stringTwo = String("This is a string");        // converting a constant string into a String object
String stringOne = String(stringTwo + " with more");  // concatenating two strings
    
```
---

## 1.6 Very Basic Code Examples

### IF / ELSE
```cpp
int temp = 25;

if (temp > 30) {
  digitalWrite(13, HIGH); // LED ON
} else {
  digitalWrite(13, LOW);  // LED OFF
}
```

# 2. Loops — How to Write `for` and `while` (properly!)

> Loops let your Arduino repeat actions **without** copy–pasting code.
> Think of them as a **metronome**: they count beats (iterations) and tell your code what to do on each beat.

---

## 2.1 `for` Loops — Counted Repetition

**When to use:**  
You know *how many times* you want to repeat something (e.g., blink 10 times, step through 3 LEDs, run 100 readings).

**Shape of a `for` loop (read left → right):**
```cpp
for (INITIALIZE;  CONDITION;  STEP) {
  // body: runs once per iteration if CONDITION is true
}
```
- **INITIALIZE** – create/set a counter *once* (e.g., `int i = 0`)
- **CONDITION** – loop continues **while this is true** (e.g., `i < 5`)
- **STEP** – how the counter changes each time (e.g., `i++` adds 1)

“Start at 0, keep going while you’re under 5, add 1 each time.”

### Basic examples
Blink exactly 3 times:
```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  digitalWrite(13, HIGH); delay(200);
  digitalWrite(13, LOW);  delay(200);
}
```

Walk through an array of pins (`0..n-1` indexing):
```cpp
int leds[] = {3, 5, 6}; //store pin numbers 3, 5, and 6 in array "leds"
int n = 3;

for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {      // i = 0,1,2
  pinMode(leds[i], OUTPUT);
  digitalWrite(leds[i], HIGH); delay(150);
  digitalWrite(leds[i], LOW);
}
```

**Indexing rule (burn this in):**  
Arrays start at **0**. The last index is **length - 1**.  
If `n == 3`, valid indices are `0, 1, 2`.

**Common off-by-one bug:**  
- ✅ `i < n` (correct)  
- ❌ `i <= n` (goes one past the end!)

---

## 2.2 `while` Loops — Repeat *until* something changes

**When to use:**  
You **don’t know** how many times you’ll repeat. You loop **while** a condition remains true (e.g., keep reading until a button is pressed).

**Shape of a `while` loop:**
```cpp
while (CONDITION) {
  // body: runs again as long as CONDITION is true
}
```

### Basic examples
Wait until button on pin 2 is pressed:
```cpp
while (digitalRead(2) == LOW) {
  // do nothing; still waiting
}
digitalWrite(13, HIGH); // button pressed → turn LED on
```

Count sensor samples until a threshold is hit:
```cpp
int count = 0;
int sensor = analogRead(A0);

while (sensor < 700) {      // keep sampling until bright
  count++;
  delay(10);
  sensor = analogRead(A0);  // update condition INSIDE loop
}
Serial.println(count);       // how many readings it took
```

> **Important:** In a `while` loop, make sure something inside the loop **changes the condition**.  
> If not, you’ve made an **infinite loop** (Arduino seems “stuck”).

---

## 2.3 `for` vs `while` — Which to pick?

- Use **`for`** when the number of iterations is known or tied to an index (`0..n-1`), especially with arrays.
- Use **`while`** when the number of iterations is unknown and depends on real-time conditions (button, sensor, serial input).

**Same behavior, two styles (blink 5 times):**
```cpp
// for
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) { digitalWrite(13, !digitalRead(13)); delay(200); }

// while
int j = 0;
while (j < 5) { digitalWrite(13, !digitalRead(13)); delay(200); j++; }
```

---

## 2.4 Stepping, skipping, and going backwards

- **Step by 2:** `for (int i = 0; i < 10; i += 2) { ... }` → 0,2,4,6,8  
- **Count down:** `for (int i = 5; i > 0; i--) { ... }` → 5,4,3,2,1  
- **Skip iterations:**  
  - `continue;` → skip to the next iteration  
  - `break;` → exit the loop entirely

Example: light only even-indexed LEDs:
```cpp
int leds[] = {3,5,6,9};
for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
  if (i % 2 == 1) continue; // skip odd indices
  digitalWrite(leds[i], HIGH); delay(100);
  digitalWrite(leds[i], LOW);
}
```

---

## 2.5 Common mistakes (and fixes)

- **Forgetting to update the condition (while):**
  ```cpp
  // ❌ sensor never changes → infinite loop
  while (sensor < 500) { /* ... */ }

  // ✅ update inside the loop
  while (sensor < 500) { sensor = analogRead(A0); }
  ```

- **Off-by-one with arrays:**
  ```cpp
  int n = 3;
  // ❌ i <= n goes out of bounds (0..3)
  for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) { /* ... */ }

  // ✅ use i < n  (0..2)
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) { /* ... */ }
  ```

### **Mini Breakout Activity 4 – For Loop LED Chase**
**Goal:** Create a “running light” effect across **4 LEDs**.  
- Use a `for` loop to turn them ON in sequence, then OFF in sequence.  
- Add a small `delay()` so the movement is visible.  
- **Bonus:** Make the chase reverse direction after reaching the last LED.

### **Mini Breakout Activity 5 – While Loop Hold**
**Goal:** While the button is pressed, make an LED blink rapidly.  
- Use a `while` loop so blinking continues until the button is released.
- **Tip:** Be careful to avoid locking the Arduino in the loop forever.

# 3. Coding Etiquette — Commenting, Indentation, Naming

> Writing code is like leaving notes for **future you** and **other people** who will read your work.  
> Even if your Arduino understands messy code, *humans* reading it will struggle — and humans fix bugs.

---

## 3.1 Commenting — Talking to Humans, Not the Computer

**What is a comment?**  
Text in your code that the Arduino **ignores** but explains what the code is doing.  

- **Single-line:** `// your note here`  
- **Multi-line:**  
  ```cpp
  /* This
     spans
     multiple lines */
  ```

**Good etiquette:**
```cpp
// Blink LED on pin 13 three times
for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  digitalWrite(13, HIGH); // LED ON
  delay(200);
  digitalWrite(13, LOW);  // LED OFF
  delay(200);
}
```

**Bad etiquette:**
```cpp
// turn on
digitalWrite(13, HIGH);
// delay
delay(200);
// turn off
digitalWrite(13, LOW);
// delay
delay(200);
```
- **Why bad?** Each comment just repeats the code.  
  Comments should explain **why**, not just **what**.

---

## 3.2 Indentation — Lining Things Up for Readability

**Indentation** = spacing code so that its **structure** is easy to see.  
Arduino IDE auto-indents with `Ctrl+T` (or `Cmd+T` on Mac).

**Good indentation:**
```cpp
void loop() {
  for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    digitalWrite(13, HIGH);
    delay(200);
    digitalWrite(13, LOW);
    delay(200);
  }
}
```

**Bad indentation (works, but hurts your eyes):**
```cpp
void loop(){for(int i=0;i<3;i++){digitalWrite(13,HIGH);delay(200);digitalWrite(13,LOW);delay(200);}}
```
- **Why bad?** Hard to see where loops start/end, easy to miss semicolons or braces.

---

## 3.3 Naming — Clear and Consistent

**Good etiquette:**
- Use descriptive names: `ledPin`, `buttonPin`, `sensorValue`
- Follow one style and stick to it: `camelCase` or `snake_case`
- Constants in **ALL_CAPS**: `const int LED_PIN = 13;`

**Bad etiquette:**
```cpp
int x = 13;
int y = 2;
int z = 500;
digitalWrite(x, HIGH);
delay(z);
digitalWrite(x, LOW);
```
- **Why bad?** No clue what `x`, `y`, or `z` mean without scrolling up.  

---

## 3.4 When Bad Etiquette Breaks Compilation

Sometimes bad etiquette isn’t just ugly — it **won’t compile**:

**Example 1 — Mismatched braces/brackets:**
```cpp
void loop() {
  if (true) {
    digitalWrite(13, HIGH);
  // Missing closing brace for if → compilation error
}
```
**Error:** *expected ‘}’ before end of input*

---

**Example 2 — Inconsistent naming:**
```cpp
int LedPin = 13;
digitalWrite(ledpin, HIGH); // ledpin is not the same as LedPin
```
**Error:** *‘ledpin’ was not declared in this scope*

---

**Example 3 — Bad indentation hiding missing semicolon:**
```cpp
int ledPin = 13
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);
}
```
**Error:** *expected ‘;’ before ‘void’*

---

## 3.5 Quick Do/Don’t Table

| **Do**                                | **Don’t**                                 |
|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Use clear variable names (`ledPin`)   | Use `a`, `b`, `x1` with no meaning         |
| Indent blocks inside `{}`             | Write everything on one line               |
| Comment the **why** of tricky code    | Comment obvious things only                 |
| Match case exactly (`ledPin` vs `LedPin`) | Change capitalization mid-program       |
| Use `Ctrl+T` to auto-format            | Leave braces/spacing random                 |

# 4. Wiring — Connecting Your Arduino to the Real World

> If code is the **brain**, wiring is the **nervous system** — it’s how your Arduino senses and controls the physical world.  
> Bad wiring is like sending your brain’s signals to the wrong muscles — things won’t work, or they’ll work *very* strangely.

## 4.1 Anatomy of an Arduino Uno for Wiring

An Arduino Uno has a variety of pins, each with a specific purpose:

| **Pin Type**     | **Label**                  | **Purpose** |
|------------------|----------------------------|-------------|
| **Digital Pins** | `0`–`13`                   | ON/OFF signals (HIGH or LOW). Can be INPUT or OUTPUT. Pins with `~` also support PWM (`analogWrite()` style output). |
| **Analog Pins**  | `A0`–`A5`                  | Read variable voltages (0–5V) and convert to numbers with `analogRead()`. |
| **Power Pins**   | `5V`, `3.3V`                | Provide fixed voltage to power sensors, modules, LEDs (within current limits). |
| **Ground (GND)** | `GND`                       | Reference point for all voltages — must be connected for a circuit to work. |
| **VIN**          | `VIN`                       | Supply voltage to the board (if powering from external source). |

**Key fact:** Digital pins can also act as inputs. Analog pins can be used as digital pins (`A0` = digital pin 14).

---

## 4.2 Ground — The Unsung Hero

Think of **Ground (GND)** as the "zero point" in your electrical world.  
If electricity is water in a pipe:
- **Voltage** = water pressure
- **Current** = flow of water
- **Ground** = drain back to the tank

Without a path to ground, the "water" has nowhere to go — your circuit won’t run.

---

## 4.3 Breadboard Basics

A breadboard is your prototyping playground.

- **Rows:** Horizontal power rails (`+` and `–`), often along the top and bottom, used to distribute 5V/3.3V and GND.
- **Columns:** Groups of 5 holes connected vertically in the center area — components and jumper wires go here.
- **Gap in the Middle:** Separates the left and right sides so you can plug in ICs or connect across with wires.

**Analogy:** Imagine the breadboard as a neighborhood:
- Houses in the same **column group** share the same plumbing (electrical connection).
- Power rails are like main streets carrying electricity across the whole board.

---

## 4.4 Wiring Rules of Thumb

1. **Match the circuit to the voltage** — sensors rated for 3.3V can be damaged by 5V.
2. **Always share ground** — Arduino GND must connect to the ground of any sensor or external device.
3. **Short = Bad** — directly connecting 5V to GND without a load (like a resistor) will cause overheating or damage.
4. **Use resistors with LEDs** — to limit current (220–330 Ω typical for 5V LEDs).
5. **Double-check polarity** — many devices (LEDs, motors, sensors) have a positive and negative side.

---

## 4.5 Physics in 60 Seconds — Why Wiring Works

- **Voltage (V)** = electrical "pressure" pushing electrons through the circuit.
- **Current (I)** = flow of electrons, measured in Amps.
- **Resistance (R)** = opposition to current.
- **Ohm’s Law:** `V = I × R`

Example: An LED might drop 2V and want 20mA.  
Resistor needed: `(5V - 2V) ÷ 0.02A = 150 Ω` (so use 220 Ω to be safe).

For those attending on Friday, you will get exposure to hands-on wiring!

# 5. Using a Pushbutton with Arduino

---

## 5.1 What Is a Pushbutton?

A pushbutton is a **momentary switch** — it only changes state while you press it.  
- When **not pressed**, the circuit is **open** → no current flows.  
- When **pressed**, the circuit **closes** → current flows.  
- In TinkerCAD, you can simulate pressing it by clicking it during the simulation.

---

### Physics Behind It
Think of it like a **drawbridge** for electricity:
- Bridge **up** → no cars (electrons) can cross → circuit open.
- Bridge **down** → cars (electrons) can cross → circuit closed.

Inside a pushbutton are **springy metal contacts**:
- Pressing the button pushes these contacts together, completing the circuit between two pins.
- Releasing the button lets the spring push them apart again.

---

## 5.2 The 4 Legs of a Pushbutton

A standard pushbutton has **four legs** arranged in pairs:
```
| 1   2 |
| 3   4 |
```
- Pins **1 & 2** are connected internally.
- Pins **3 & 4** are connected internally.
- The button **connects both sides** only when pressed.

---

## 5.3 Wiring in Arduino (TinkerCAD)

We’ll use the Arduino Uno’s **internal pull-up resistor** to make wiring simpler.

**Wiring:**
1. One side of the button → Arduino digital pin (e.g., Pin 2).
2. Other side of the button → **GND**.
3. No extra resistor is needed — the `INPUT_PULLUP` mode uses Arduino’s built-in 20–50kΩ resistor.

**Breadboard Tip:**
- Make sure the button is placed across the center “gap” of the breadboard so each side is isolated until pressed.

---

## 5.4 How INPUT_PULLUP Works

Normally, floating inputs can randomly read HIGH or LOW.  
Using `INPUT_PULLUP`:
- Arduino keeps the pin **HIGH** by default (connected weakly to +5V through resistor).
- Pressing the button connects the pin to **GND** → reads **LOW**.

This means:
- **Pressed = LOW**
- **Not pressed = HIGH**

---

## 5.5 Example Code — Button Test

```cpp
// Pin setup
const int buttonPin = 2; // Button connected to Pin 2

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);          // Start Serial Monitor
  pinMode(buttonPin, INPUT_PULLUP); // Enable internal pull-up
}

void loop() {
  int buttonState = digitalRead(buttonPin);

  if (buttonState == LOW) {
    Serial.println("Button is PRESSED");
  } else {
    Serial.println("Button is NOT pressed");
  }

  delay(200); // Small delay to make it readable
}
```

---

### 5.6 Demo in TinkerCAD
Wire the pushbutton so one leg is to **Pin 2**, the opposite leg is to **GND**.

## 6. Breakout Activities (TinkerCAD)

Now it’s time to put today’s concepts into practice!  
These challenges are designed so you can complete them in TinkerCAD, using an Arduino Uno, breadboard, LEDs, resistors, and a pushbutton.

---

### **Activity 1 – If-Else-If Pattern Challenge**
**Goal:**  
- Use **three LEDs** (red, yellow, green).  
- Press the button **once** → only red LED ON.  
- Press the button **twice** → only yellow LED ON.  
- Press the button **three times** → only green LED ON.  
- Then cycle back to red.  
- **Hint:** You’ll need a variable to keep track of button presses.

---

### **Activity 2 – Morse Code Button Press**
**Goal:**  
- Use the **built-in LED** to flash “SOS” in Morse code (`... --- ...`).  
- Button press starts the sequence; releasing stops it.  
- **Hint:** Dots are short blinks, dashes are longer blinks.

---

### **Activity 3 – The Pushbutton Memory Game**
**Goal:**  
- Arduino shows a sequence of LEDs lighting up (like Simon Says).  
- Use `for` loops to create the sequence.  
- Pressing the button at the right time “matches” the light, and Arduino responds with a successful blink (separate green LED).  
- Keep it simple—just 2–3 steps for now.

---

### **Activity 4 – Button + LED Dimming**
**Goal:**  
- Connect an LED to a PWM pin (like Pin 9).  
- Each button press increases LED brightness by 50 (0–255 scale).  
- When it passes 255, wrap back to 0 (OFF).  
- **Hint:** Use `analogWrite()`.

## 7. Wrap-Up

###  What You Should Know Now:
- How to use **if**, **else**, and **if-else** statements to control program flow.
- How to write and understand **for loops** and **while loops**, including their differences.
- How to declare and call **functions** to organize code.
- How to properly comment, indent, and name variables for clean, readable code.
- Basics of **Arduino wiring**: voltage pins, ground pins, and digital/PWM pins.
- How a **pushbutton** works physically and in code, and how to use `digitalRead()` to detect button states.
- How to combine logic with wiring to create interactive projects in TinkerCAD.

###  Homework / Practice:
- Recreate at least **two** of today’s breakout activities in TinkerCAD from scratch (don’t reuse your saved version).
- Practice adding **print statements** in the `setup()` function to display messages in the Serial Monitor.
